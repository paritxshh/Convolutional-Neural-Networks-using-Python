# Convolutional-Neural-Networks-using-Python
CNN, short for Convolutional Neural Network, is a type of artificial neural network that is commonly used in computer vision applications, such as image and video recognition, classification, and segmentation.

# Architecture
It is designed to automatically learn hierarchical representations of input data by applying convolutional filters to it. The filters capture spatial patterns and relationships between pixels or features in the input, and the resulting feature maps are then combined and passed through additional layers, such as pooling and fully connected layers, to perform classification or regression tasks.
